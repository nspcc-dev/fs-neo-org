            NeoFS network nodes run the same software and talk the same protocol but may have different roles. There are
            nodes that store data and process user API requests, they are regular storage nodes that form the Outer
            Ring. There are nodes that take care of network health, perform service tasks, such as data audit and
            payments settlements, and form the Inner Ring. There are not many of them and they use dBFT 2.0 consensus
            algorithm to coordinate their actions.</p>

                        Inner Ring nodes are connected to Neo Blockchain. They are constantly monitoring events coming
                        from the blockchain to synchronize their state and the state of NeoFS smart contract that
                        manages users' money deposits and information about Inner Ring nodes themselves.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Since the Inner Ring is a critical infrastructure part, not every node may get this role. The
                        node willing to join the Inner Ring should be registered in NeoFS smart contract in Neo
                        Blockchain and pay some security deposit that is lost in case of the node starts to behave
                        badly.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        In addition, in the same way as Neo consensus nodes, NeoFS Inner Ring nodes try to achieve
                        maximal possible geographical, political and network decentralization.</p>

            The main use case for NeoFS is DApps's data storage and content distribution. Nowadays most DApps do not
            store their assets in a decentralized fashion that makes them not really distributed applications. In NeoFS,
            DApps can upload content and distribute it to clients via protocol gates using standard HTTPS protocol or,
            for example, using NeoFS API from mobile application.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            DApps can access NeoFS directly from smart contract code. For instance, DApp's smart contract can generate
            some data and put it into NeoFS rather then storing it in the blockchain. Storing data off-chain is
            significantly cheaper and easier to deliver to client.

                        Inner Ring nodes monitor the state of NeoFS storage nodes. Using this information, they maintain
                        up-to-date Network Map. It is a multi-dimensional graph where nodes have attributes and are
                        grouped by those attributes and their values. This allows using a special data placement
                        function to find nodes that would store an object when putting or getting it in/from NeoFS
                        network.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            This approach allows not having any centralized meta-data storage keeping object's locations and not
            re-balancing data with every joining or leaving storage node, as it happens in DHT-based systems.</p>

        </div>



        <p class="mb-4"> As files are organized in directories in file system, objects are organized in containers in
            NeoFS.</p>




        <p class="mb-4">
            Each container is served by a subset of storage nodes that satisfy storage policy defined for this
            particular container by the user. To calculate that nodesâ€™ subset, storage policy filters are applied to
            Network Map. The resulting set of nodes is responsible for making sure that storage policy is satisfied and
            data is not corrupted. In case of success, they share users' payment for data storage. One storage node may
            serve many containers, so if it behaves correctly small shares from each container summ-up in a significant
            reward. The same is true for the losses in case of container nodes' misbehavior. This motivates nodes to
            keep an eye on other container members and properly perform all required replication, migration and data
            recovery processes.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Another non-obvious benefit of this approach is the bigger NeoFS network grows, the more stable it becomes,
            because the chance of network is changed would affect a particular container is decreasing with the
            increasing number of nodes in the network. It means, unlike in DHT approach, the amount of needed data
            migration decreases with network growth.</p>

            <h2>Protocol Gates</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-4">
            To interact with existing systems using standard protocols, NeoFS has protocol gates. Gates are mainly
            maintained by users and not a part of NeoFS network. From the start, HTTP protocol gate is provided, that
            allows accessing data from NeoFS using regular browser. Further, AWS S3 and OpenStack Object Storage gates
            will be provided to allow users to make more sophisticated integrations. Technically one may easily develop
            own gate by using NeoFS protocol libraries.
